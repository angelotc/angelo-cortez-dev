In this post, I'll walk you through how I turned property listings into vectors for [Nippon Homes](https://nipponhomes.com/) and used them to surface homes you're likely to love.

## The Core Idea: Properties as Vectors

Imagine every property as a point floating in 9-dimensional space. Similar properties cluster together—small Tokyo condos in one region, spacious countryside houses in another.

When you browse listings, we're essentially watching which regions of this space you're drawn to. After a few views, we can compute your "preference center" and find other properties nearby.

Mathematically, we represent each listing as a **9d feature vector**:

$$
\vec{v}_{\text{listing}} = [d_0, d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_8] \in \mathbb{R}^9
$$

Each dimension captures something meaningful about the property.

### Seeing It In Action

Here's what this looks like with **real properties** from the Nippon Homes database. Below are 6 Tokyo condos and 6 Hokkaido houses, all similarly priced (¥22M-¥40M). Despite similar prices, they live in completely different regions of our 9-dimensional space.

Since we can't visualize 9 dimensions, I've used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to project them into 3D:

Notice the clear separation: **blue points (Tokyo condos)** cluster together in one region, while **orange points (Hokkaido houses)** form their own distinct group. This isn't magic—it's the natural result of how we encode the features. Tokyo condos are smaller (48-64㎡) with higher price-per-㎡, while Hokkaido houses are spacious (74-251㎡) with more rooms.

When you browse Tokyo condos, your preference vector moves toward the blue cluster. The system then finds other nearby blue points (similar condos) you haven't seen yet.

## The 9 Dimensions We Track

Here's the actual PostgreSQL trigger function called `get_personalized_rankings` that computes the feature vector whenever a listing is inserted or updated:

```sql
DECLARE
    vector_data vector(9);
    normalized_rooms TEXT;
    room_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    normalized_rooms := normalize_rooms(NEW.rooms);
    room_count := COALESCE(
        (regexp_match(normalized_rooms, '(\d+)'))[1]::integer,
        3
    );

    -- Scaling strategy: heuristic z-score normalization
    -- Centers ≈ dataset mean (e.g., 100m² actual mean: 100.7m²)
    -- Scales ≈ "practical range" (~0.5-1σ), NOT true standard deviations
    -- This keeps most values in [-2, +2] and prevents high-variance
    -- features from dominating distance calculations.
    -- Binary features use ±1 for equal "vote weight" regardless of
    -- class imbalance.

    vector_data := ARRAY[
        -- Dim 0: Size — center 100m² ≈ mean, scale 50 (~0.6σ, actual σ≈85)
        (COALESCE(NEW.size_sqm, 100) - 100.0) / 50.0,

        -- Dim 1: Price — log-scaled, center 17 ≈ ln(¥24M) ≈ actual mean 17.03
        (LN(GREATEST(COALESCE(NEW.price, 25000000), 1000000)) - 17.0) / 1.0,

        -- Dim 2: Price/m² — center 300k (actual mean ~454k, Tokyo skews high)
        -- Scale 200k (~0.3σ) compresses outliers intentionally
        CASE
            WHEN COALESCE(NEW.size_sqm, 0) > 10
            THEN (COALESCE(NEW.price, 0) / NEW.size_sqm - 300000.0) / 200000.0
            ELSE 0
        END,

        -- Dim 3: Age — center 25 years, scale 15
        (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - COALESCE(NEW.year_built, 1995) - 25.0) / 15.0,

        -- Dim 4: Room count — center 3.5, scale 1.5
        (room_count - 3.5) / 1.5,

        -- Dim 5-8: Binary features use ±1 (not normalized to class imbalance)
        -- This gives equal weight in distance calculations

        -- Dim 5: LDK flag (modern layout)
        CASE WHEN normalized_rooms LIKE '%LDK%' THEN 1.0 ELSE -1.0 END,

        -- Dim 6: Listing type (house vs condo)
        CASE WHEN NEW.listing_type = '中古一戸建て' THEN 1.0 ELSE -1.0 END,

        -- Dim 7: Size efficiency (sqm per room) — center 25, scale 10
        (COALESCE(NEW.size_sqm, 100) / GREATEST(room_count, 1) - 25.0) / 10.0,

        -- Dim 8: Has storage room (+S or SLDK pattern)
        CASE WHEN normalized_rooms ~ '\+S|S[LDK]' THEN 1.0 ELSE -1.0 END

    ]::vector(9);

    INSERT INTO vecs.listing_vecs (id, vec, listing_id)
    VALUES (NEW.id, vector_data, NEW.listing_id)
    ON CONFLICT (id)
    DO UPDATE SET
        vec = EXCLUDED.vec,
        listing_id = EXCLUDED.listing_id;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
```

The scaling isn't mathematically pure z-score normalization, but it works well for similarity search. The key insight: using ~0.5-1σ as the scale (instead of true σ) keeps most values bounded and prevents high-variance features from dominating.

## Computing Your Preference Vector

As you browse, we track which listings you view. After you've seen at least 3 properties, we compute your **preference centroid**—the average of all vectors you've engaged with:

$$
\vec{p}_{\text{user}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vec{v}_i
$$

Where n is the number of listings you've viewed.

**Example:** If you viewed three properties:
- A small Tokyo condo: $\vec{v}_1 = [-1, 0.5, 1, -0.5, -1, 1, -1, -0.5, -1]$
- Another small condo: $\vec{v}_2 = [-0.8, 0.3, 0.8, 0, -0.7, 1, -1, -0.3, -1]$
- A compact apartment: $\vec{v}_3 = [-1.2, 0.4, 1.2, -0.3, -1, 1, -1, -0.7, 1]$

Your preference vector becomes the element-wise average—pointing toward "small, reasonably-priced Tokyo condos."

**Computing the centroid:**

$$
\vec{p}_{\text{user}} = \begin{bmatrix}
-1.0 \\
0.4 \\
1.0 \\
-0.27 \\
-0.9 \\
1.0 \\
-1.0 \\
-0.5 \\
-0.33
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This centroid vector represents your inferred preference profile. Here's how it looks in 3D space:

<PreferenceCentroidVisualization vectors={[
  {
    label: "Property 1",
    vector: [-1, 0.5, 1, -0.5, -1, 1, -1, -0.5, -1],
    description: "Small Tokyo condo"
  },
  {
    label: "Property 2",
    vector: [-0.8, 0.3, 0.8, 0, -0.7, 1, -1, -0.3, -1],
    description: "Another small condo"
  },
  {
    label: "Property 3",
    vector: [-1.2, 0.4, 1.2, -0.3, -1, 1, -1, -0.7, 1],
    description: "Compact apartment"
  }
]} />

---

## Finding Similar Properties

With your preference vector computed, we find the closest unviewed properties using **Euclidean distance** (L2):

$$
\text{distance}(\vec{p}, \vec{v}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{8} (p_i - v_i)^2}
$$

To convert distance into a similarity score between 0 and 1, we use:

$$
\text{similarity} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{distance}}
$$

This formula has nice properties:
- **Distance = 0** → Similarity = 1 (perfect match)
- **Distance = 1** → Similarity = 0.5
- **Distance → ∞** → Similarity → 0

---

## Making It Fast: HNSW Indexing

With thousands of listings, computing distances to every property would be slow. We use **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** indexing via pgvector:

```sql
CREATE INDEX listing_vecs_vec_idx
ON vecs.listing_vecs
USING hnsw (vec vector_l2_ops);
```

HNSW builds a graph structure that allows approximate nearest-neighbor search in **O(log n)** time instead of O(n). For our ~50k listings, this means queries complete in milliseconds.

---

## The Complete Query

Here's the actual PostgreSQL function that powers recommendations:

```sql
WITH preference_vector AS (
  -- Compute centroid of viewed listings
  SELECT AVG(v.vec)::vector(9) as pref_vec
  FROM vecs.listing_vecs v
  WHERE v.listing_id = ANY(viewed_ids)
),
top_matches AS (
  SELECT
    lv.listing_id,
    -- Convert distance to similarity score
    (1.0 / (1.0 + (lv.vec <-> pv.pref_vec))) as score
  FROM vecs.listing_vecs lv
  CROSS JOIN preference_vector pv
  WHERE
    pv.pref_vec IS NOT NULL
    AND lv.listing_id != ALL(viewed_ids)  -- Exclude already viewed
  ORDER BY lv.vec <-> pv.pref_vec  -- L2 distance operator
  LIMIT 100
)
SELECT * FROM top_matches ORDER BY score DESC;
```

The `<->` operator computes L2 distance and leverages the HNSW index automatically.

---

## Exploration vs. Exploitation (adding diversity to ranked results)

A pure similarity-based system has a problem: it can create **filter bubbles**. If you only see properties similar to what you've viewed, you might miss great options outside your initial exploration. Inside the Next.JS function, after we call `get_personalization_rankings` 
re-rank the listings, we sort them in a format such that we interleave non-matches, to give the user a chance to explore non-similar listings (to add diversity).

We address this with **interleaving**:

$$
\text{results} = [\text{relevant}_0, \text{random}_0, \text{relevant}_1, \text{random}_1, \ldots]
$$

Every other result is a random property from the candidate set. This ensures:
1. You see your best matches
2. You discover properties you might not have found otherwise
3. The system learns from your reactions to diverse options

---

## What's Next?

This is version 1. Future improvements that I have pondered about:

- **Dwell-time weighting:** Properties you spent more time viewing should influence your preference vector more. Tried to implement this but ran into some errors. May revisit.
- **Recency decay:** Recently viewed listings matter **more** than listing views from last week. 
- **Learning to rank (LTR):** Meta, Google, and other big companies use LTR to rank their ads effectively. From the developers that I spoke to there, it sounded like they tend to just use XGBoost for their late stage rankers. Use click-through data to tune dimension weights. There's a few things I want to experiment in this area:
  - LightGBM/XGBoost with LambdaMART
  - Vowpal Wabbit for multi-armed bandits
  - Simple MLP neural net
- **Image embeddings:** I've prototyped this for Hokkaido listings using [LiquidAI's LFM2-VL-1.6B model](https://github.com/angelotc/lfm2-vl-embeddings). Visual embeddings from property photos are fused with the 9-dimensional metadata through an MLP into 128-dimensional vectors for similarity search. I'm kinda GPU-poor though so, I'll stick to the basics for now.

For now, the simple centroid approach works remarkably well. Sometimes the best solution is the one you can explain on a napkin.
